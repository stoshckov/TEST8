# Git Practice Guide

## 1. Set Up a Repository
```
mkdir <project-name>
cd <project-name>
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit with README.md"
Explanation: Initializes a new repository and adds a starter file.

2. Create a New Branch


git branch <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>
Or use:



git checkout -b <branch-name>
Explanation: Creates and switches to a new branch for your work.

3. Make Changes
Create or edit files:


touch <file-name>
echo "Some content" > <file-name>
Stage the changes:


git add <file-name>
Commit the changes:


git commit -m "Add <file-name>"
4. Push the New Branch to GitHub


git push -u origin <branch-name>
Explanation: Pushes the branch and sets up tracking with the remote.

5. Check the Status and Compare Branches
Check your branch status:


git status
See differences with another branch (e.g., main):


git diff main..<branch-name>
View commits unique to the branch:


git log main..<branch-name> --oneline
6. Merge Branch into Main
Switch to main:


git checkout main
Merge the branch:


git merge <branch-name>
Explanation: Combines the changes from your branch into main.

7. Clean Up
Delete the branch locally:


git branch -d <branch-name>
Delete the branch from the remote:


git push origin --delete <branch-name>
Practice Routine
Create a repository and set up a simple project.
Follow steps 2-5 to create new branches, make changes, and push them.
Practice merging and resolving conflicts by modifying the same file in main and a feature
